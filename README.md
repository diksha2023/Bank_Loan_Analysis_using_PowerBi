# Bank Loan Analysis using PowerBI

## Project Overview
This project uses Power BI to analyze bank loan data to gain insights into loan distributions, borrower demographics,and repayment 
performance. The analysis aims to help the bank make informed decisions on loan approvals, identify trends, and improve risk management.

## Introduction
In the competitive banking industry, understanding customer profiles and loan performance is crucial for risk management and business 
growth. This project utilizes Power BI to analyze and visualize bank loan data, providing actionable insights for the bank.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project includes information about:
*	Loan ID
*	Borrower demographics (age, gender, employment status, etc.)
*	Loan details (amount, interest rate, term, etc.)
*	Repayment performance (status of loan, missed payments, etc.)

## Dashboard 1: Summary
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
1.	**Total Loan Applications:** Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including
   	Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
2.	**Total Funded Amount:** Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and analyze MoM changes.
3.	**Total Amount Received:** Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total
  	Amount Received and MoM changes.
4.	**Average Interest Rate:** Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.
5.	**Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track
  	MoM fluctuations.
### Summary Visualization:
Loan Status Grid View: Gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor loan performance categorized by 'Loan Status'. 
This grid view provides insights into metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded 
Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

## Dashboard 2: Overview
1.	**Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
2.	**Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
3.	**Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4.	**Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Assess how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths.
5.	**Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on stated purposes of loans.
6.	**Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** View how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements hierarchically.
   
## Dashboard 3: Details

**Objective:**

The Details Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key loan-related metrics and data points, facilitating efficient access 
to critical information about loan portfolios, borrower profiles, and loan performance.

**Dataset Used:**

The bank loan analysis dataset comprises essential fields such as Loan ID, Address State, Purpose, Grade, Sub Grade, Annual Income,
Loan Status, Last Payment Date, Verification Status, Debt-to-Income Ratio, and Interest Rates. These fields provide insights into 
borrower demographics, employment stability, loan characteristics, risk assessment, and payment behavior.
